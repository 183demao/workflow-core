# Workflow Core 1.2.8

* Added .Schedule() API, to future date a block of steps to run in parallel to the rest of the workflow.

This following example will execute the block of steps after 3 days
```c#
builder                
    .StartWith<HelloWorld>()
    .Schedule(data => TimeSpan.FromDays(3)).Do(block => 
        block.StartWith<DoSomething>()
        .Then<DoSomethingElse>())
    .Then<GoodbyeWorld>();
```

* Added inline action steps API

```c#
builder                
    .StartWith(context => Console.WriteLine("Hello!"))
    .Then(context => Console.WriteLine("Bye!"));
```

* Discontinued support for .NET 4.5.2 (.NET 4.6 is .NET Standard 1.3 compatible)
