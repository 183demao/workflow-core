# Workflow Core 1.7.0

* Various performance optimizations, any users of the EntityFramework persistence providers will have to update their persistence libraries to the latest version as well.
* Create a new `WorkflowCore.Providers.Redis` library that includes providers for distributed locking, queues and event hubs.
* Deprecated `WorkflowCore.LockProviders.RedLock` in favour of `WorkflowCore.Providers.Redis`
* Added `CancelCondition` to fluent builder API.

```
.CancelCondition(data => <<expression>>, <<Continue after cancellation>>)

```

This allows you to specify a condition under which any active step can be prematurely cancelled.
For example, suppose you create a future scheduled task, but you want to cancel the future execution of this task if some condition becomes true.


```c#
builder
    .StartWith(context => Console.WriteLine("Hello"))
    .Schedule(data => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)).Do(schedule => schedule
        .StartWith<DoSomething>()
		.Then<DoSomethingFurther>()
    )
    .CancelCondition(data => !data.SheduledTaskRequired)
    .Then(context => Console.WriteLine("Doing normal tasks"));
```

You could also use this implement a parallel flow where once a single path completes, all the other paths are cancelled.

```c#
.Parallel()
    .Do(then => then
		.StartWith<DoSomething>()
        .WaitFor("Approval", (data, context) => context.Workflow.IdNow)
	)
    .Do(then => then
		.StartWith<DoSomething>()
        .Delay(data => TimeSpan.FromDays(3))
		.Then<EscalateIssue>()
	)
.Join()
	.CancelCondition(data => data.IsApproved, true)
.Then<MoveAlong>();
```
