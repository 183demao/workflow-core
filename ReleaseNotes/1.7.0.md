# Workflow Core 1.7.0

### Added `CancelCondition` to fluent builder API.

```
.CancelCondition(data => <<expression>>)

```

This allows you to specify a condition under which any active step can be prematurely cancelled.
For example, suppose you create a future scheduled task, but you want to cancel the future execution of this task if some condition becomes true.


```c#
builder
    .StartWith(context => Console.WriteLine("Hello"))
    .Schedule(data => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)).Do(schedule => schedule
        .StartWith<DoSomething>()
		.Then<DoSomethingFurther>()
    )
    .CancelCondition(data => !data.SheduledTaskRequired)
    .Then(context => Console.WriteLine("Doing normal tasks"));
```
